Project Overview: Analyzing Unhealthy Eating Habits
Our system is designed to assess whether an individual is at risk of unhealthy eating habits by considering various factors related to their diet and lifestyle. Using S(CASP) AI logic programming, we ensure the system is inclusive and adaptable to the diverse needs of all students.

The system evaluates multiple aspects of eating behavior, such as food choices, nutritional intake, and underlying medical conditions, to provide a comprehensive risk assessment. By doing so, it aims to foster healthy eating habits and encourage better dietary decisions, tailored to each studentâ€™s unique requirements. This approach combines advanced AI-driven logic with an inclusive mindset, empowering individuals to make informed, health-conscious choices.
